# progress-bar-interview-task

An example of a live coding task for a job interview.

## Overview

A simple live coding task that should tell you more about interviewees than dozens of
hackneyed questions about their motivation and coding quirks that no one will ever use.

The task is about practical aspects of everyday work, not mathematical puzzles, and it tests:
- The ability to understand specifications (and respond to evolving requirements).
- Basic framework knowledge (structuring, building and communicating components).
- HTML & CSS experience (even simple layouts can be overcomplicated in many ways).
- General attention to detail, consistency and coding style (everyone talks about reusable code,
  but very few actually do it).

## Specifications
